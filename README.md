Maintainer: [Martin Scheiber](mailto:martin.scheiber@aau.at)

This is a modified fork of the [osrf/nodelet_rosbag](https://github.com/osrf/nodelet_rosbag) as used within the [CNS Flight Stack] for recording data in rosbags using nodelets (direct transfer via memeory rather than TCP/IP) wherever possible (depending on the "sender").

## Building the package
```bash
catkin build nodelet_rosbag
```

## Run the nodelet_rosbag

### Using the launch file

```bash
roslaunch nodelet_rosbag nodelet_rosbag.launch start_manager:=True # if you want to start the manager
roslaunch nodelet_rosbag nodelet_rosbag.launch nodelet_manager_name:=<manager_name> # if another manager already exists
```

#### Default Launchfile Parameters

The default parameters are setup for camera recordings, as nodelets have the most performance impact on images.

| ROS parameter | description | default value |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| `rosbag_path` | path to record the bagfile(s) to | `${HOME}/recordings` |
| `rosbag_prefix` | prefix of the recorded file | `cam` |
| `rosbag_topics` | array of topics to record | `[/mission_cam/image_raw]` |
| `start_manager` | starts the nodelet manager | `false` |
| `nodelet_manager_name` | name of the ROS nodelet manager | `nodelet_manager` |
| `respawn` | autorespawn the manager and nodelet if they die or are killed | `false` |


### Using individual commands
Read the [official document on running a nodelet](http://wiki.ros.org/nodelet/Tutorials/Running%20a%20nodelet).

#### TAB1:
```bash
roscore
```

#### TAB2:
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun nodelet nodelet manager __name:=nodelet_manager
```

#### TAB3:

Start the `nodelet_rosbag` by specifying the `rosbag_path` and a list of topics to record `rosbag_topics`.

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch nodelet_rosbag nodelet_rosbag.launch rosbag_path:=/tmp rosbag_topics:="[/mission_cam/image_raw,/mission_cam/image_rect,/mission_cam/rgb]"
```
